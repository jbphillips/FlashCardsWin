ALS,"Amieotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Garrig's Disease. You loose all muscle control except for eye movement. Your mind remains intact with your eyes the only thing you can communicate with. Like being trapped in a shell"
Anaphylaxis,Generalized massive response to an antigen causing body wide mast cell degranulation
Boerhaave Syndrome,"Spontaneous rupture of the lower esophagus a variant of Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Rupture of the esophagus. It is generally caused by excessive vomiting in eating disorders such as bulimia although it may rarely occur in extremely forceful coughing or other situations. It can cause pneumomediastinum and/or mediastinitis (air or inflammation of the mediastinum) and sepsis.Esophageal rupture in Boerhaave syndrome is thought to be the result of a sudden rise in internal esophageal pressure produced during vomiting... as a result of neuromuscular incoordination causing failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle (a sphincter within the esophagus) to relax. The syndrome is commonly associated with the consumption of excessive food and/or alcohol. The most common anatomical location of the tear in Boerhaave syndrome is at left posterolateral wall of the lower third of the esophagus... 2-3 cm before the stomach."

Dressler Syndrome,"A post MI complication that can occur in two weeks to nine months after MI. The three symptoms are:  1. Pericarditis   2. Pleural effusion  3. Pericardial effusion. Dressler's syndrome causes the following signs and symptoms after heart surgery... a heart attack or an injury to the heart:* Chest pain * Shortness of breath or pain when breathing (pleurisy) * Fever * Left shoulder pain... Dressler's syndrome is thought to develop as an immune system response following a heart attack or heart surgery. Your body's reaction to a heart injury is similar to its reaction to a virus or other illness. It responds to injury and illness by sending proteins called antibodies. The antibodies cause inflammation... and the symptoms of Dressler's syndrome develop... Treatment is usually with NSAIDS.
Dyspepsia,"Acid Indigestion. Intermittent rare discomfort that can be relieved by medication or identifying the offending food. Occurs 1 - 2 x per month"
Endodemetriosis,"Lining of the uterus ends up outside the uterus in the abdominal cavity. Can cause infertility severe menstrual bleeding... cramps."
Esophageal Bolus,"Esophageal achalasia. Usually food stuck in the esophageous... pts will think they are choking with large volumes of drooling. A piece of food is lodged in the esophagus and behind the trachea giving the sensation of choking... although the Pt will be breathing and speaking adequately. There will be increased mucous production in the superior portion of the esophagus and the Pt will spit up tenacious mucous. This is a painful spasm for the Pt. This condition can also be caused by an esophageal carcinoma. This can be treated with nitroglycerine (btw. 1-3 q 5min.) because it's a smooth muscle relaxer and will relieve the spasms. One novel way to deal with this is to have the Pt drink something carbonated... apply a proper Sellick's maneuver and have them hold it for a minute or two. The CO2 will expand and cause the esophagus to expand around the obstruction; this will usually relieve it but these Pt's should still be trx to r/o esophageal carcinoma. Presbyesophagus (an old esophagus) can also cause this condition."
Gastritis,Stomach inflammation
GERD,"Gastric Esophageal Reflux Disease... often seen in pregnancy... back up of gastric juices into the esophagus. Episodes or dyspepsia greater than two times a week despite appropriate care. This causes chronic irritation that can over the long term, cause esophageal cancer."

Hernia,"A hernia is a loop of bowel that has passed through a muscular wall due to stromal integrity. Most are reducible simply by physically pushing it back through the opening. Anterior abd, scrotal and inguinal hernias are the most common."
Hiatal Hernia,"Protrusion of stomach into mediastinal cavity thru the diaphragm. This is a hernia specifically at the esophagogastic junction. There is stromal tissue that anchors the diaphragm to the esophagus. A hiatal hernia is loss of integrity if this stromal tissue causing the stomach to herniated through the cardiac sphincter. This usually only occurs on one side of the sphincter. There is a sliding hiatal hernia and a fixed hiatal hernia. This allows for production of HCl in the epigastrium which the esophagus is ill prepared to deal with."
Hyperkalemia,Too much potassium... causes cardiac dysrythmias... see tall peaked "T" waves that can progress to a sine wave rhythm with very high K+ levels. Treat with Calcium Bicarb and Dextrose

Lown-Ganong-Levine Syndrome,(LGL) is a syndrome of pre-excitation of the ventricles due to an accessory pathway providing an abnormal electrical communication from the atria to the ventricles. It is grouped with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome as an atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT). Like WPW but without the Delta wave. 
Leukoplakia,"See "Thrush" = White cottage cheese appearing growth found in the mouth of pts due to antibiotics or immineuosuppression

Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. Cartilage is a protein substance that serves as a "cushion" between the bones of the joints. Osteoarthritis is also known as degenerative arthritis.Commonly affects the hands feet spine and large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees. Primary osteoarthritis is mostly related to aging. With aging the water content of the cartilage increases and the protein makeup of cartilage degenerates. Repetitive use of the joints over the years irritates and inflames the cartilage causing joint pain and swelling. Eventually cartilage begins to degenerate by flaking or forming tiny crevasses. In advanced cases there is a total loss of the cartilage cushion between the bones of the joints. Loss of cartilage cushion causes friction between the bones leading to pain and limitation of joint mobility. Inflammation of the cartilage can also stimulate new bone outgrowths (spurs) to form around the joints.
Paralytic Ileus,No movement thru bowels. Can be caused by trauma or certain drugs (morphine)
Parkinson's Syndrome,"Chronic nervous disease slowly spreading tremor muscular weakness & rigidity peculiar gait."
Pathologic Fracture,"Fracture without trauma often in elderly"

Pickwickian Syndrome,"Pts are so obese they have respitory failure. Usually weigh over 450 lbs. sleep sitting up, always tired because CO2 is retained & is a depressant. Almost always smoke burns on them from falling asleep with cigarettes."
Postpericardiotomy Syndrome,"See "Dressler Syndrome" Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) is a febrile illness secondary to an inflammatory reaction involving the pleura and pericardium. It is more common in patients who have undergone surgery that involves opening the pericardium. However postpericardiotomy syndrome has also been described following myocardial infarction (Dressler syndrome) and as an unusual complication after percutaneous procedures such as coronary stent implantation after implantation of epicardial pacemaker leads and transvenous pacemaker leads and following blunt trauma stab wounds and heart puncture.
Pulmonary Edema,Fluid in lungs due to left heart failure sometimes seen in right failure
Raynauds,"Can't tolerate cold poor circulation to hands & feet. (pronounced ray-noze)"
Reye's Syndrome,Illness of uncertain etiology that results in alterations of mental function in children. Often associated with viral infections and use of ASA. Why you should be wary of giving ASA to a ped with flu-like symptoms. This sometimes will result in death.
Rheumatoid arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation of the tissue around the joints as well as other organs in the body. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body tissues are mistakenly attacked by it's own immune system. The immune system is a complex organization of cells and antibodies designed normally to "seek and destroy" invaders of the body particularly infections. Patients with autoimmune diseases have antibodies in their blood that target their own body tissues where they can be associated with inflammation. Because it can affect multiple other organs of the body rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic illness and is sometimes called rheumatoid disease."
