Acute Injury,"Myocardium is dying due to lack of O2, this is the stage usually called a ""MI"""
Axis,"Direction of the vector of depolarization, normal is 0 to 90o"
Bundle Branch Block,"Can determine which bundle branch is blocked by using lead V1. A left BBB will be a negative deflection .12 secs or greater. A Right BBB will be a positive deflection .11 secs or greater. If pt has a LBBB,  you can not diagnose MI from the 12 lead EKG. "
Early Repolariztion,"Can mimic ST elevation, this is commonly seen in healthly black men as a normal condition"
Infarct Location,"Leads II III aVF = inferior wall MI or DMI                                                                                                                                                 Leads I aVL V6 = Lateral wall MI                                                                                                                                                       Leads V1 V2 = Septum                                                                                                                                 Leads V3 , V4  = Anterior wall                                                                                                                            Leads V5 , V6  = Anterior lateral wall"
Ischemia,Heart is starved for O2 but no permanent injury
Pericarditis,Generalized elevation of the ST segments with an upward concavity in many leads including all three standard leads
Subendocardial Infarction,"The subendocardium is especially vulnerable to infarct because being close to the ventricular cavity, it is subject to high pressure & is first effected when coronary perfusion is inhibited. Cannot be easily recognized from EKG. "
Wolf-Parkinson-White    (WPW),Characterized by the Delta wave & very small ' PR ' interval & wide ' QRS '.
