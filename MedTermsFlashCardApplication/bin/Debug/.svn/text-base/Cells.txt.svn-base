Eukaryotic Cell,"A cell with a defined, membrane bound nucleus. It has membrane bound organelles. All of our cells are of this type."
Extracellular fluid,The liquid that surrounds a cell.
Flagella,"a structure resembling a cilia, but much larger. They are linked to locomotion or movement. Found on sperm and some bacteria. "
Glycoproteins,"A protein with a sugar molecule associated with it in order to identify cells. Every cell in the body has multiple glycoproteins, or labels, to identify it. Many organelles have glycoproteins associated with them, as well. Glycoproteins in the surface of a cell that identify the cell are called antigens. If a cell is transfused in to another body, that body will create an antibody in order to destroy it.
"
Golgi Apparatus,Modifies molecules and packages them into small membrane bound sacs called vesicles. These sacs are targetted at various locations in the cell and even to it's exterior
Gram Staining,A staining method used to identify bacteria. Bacteria can be either gram-positive or gram-negative catergory based on the composition and thickness of their cell walls (this dicates which dye they absorb). This is useful in tailoring antimicrobial therapy. 
Lysosome,"This organelle digests waste materials and food within the cell, breaking down molecules into their base components with strong digestive enzymes"
Lyozyme,An enzyme that breaks down what is inside a lysosome. 
Microfilaments,"Any number of minute fibers located throughout the cytoplasm of cells, composed of actin and functioning primarily in maintaining the structural integrity of a cell."
Mitochondria,"The ""power house"" of the cell"
Mitosis,"The process in cell division by which the nucleus divides, typically in four stages, each of which contains a complete copy of the parental chromosomes."
Myosine,"Protein in muscle cells, responsible for the elastic and contractile properties of muscle. It combines with actin to form ""actomyosin"""
Nerve cell/Neuron,A special cell that is designed for the quick transmission of electrochemical impulses. It can be very long or very branched. 
Neuron Cell Body/ Stoma,The region of the neuron that contains the bulk of the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. 
Neurotransmitter,A chemical messenger that is released from the axon terminals and moves through the synaptic cleft to stimulate the receptors on the dendrites.
Nucleoside,"Any of various compounds consisting of a sugar, usually ribose or deoxyribose, and a purine or pyrimidine base, especially a compound obtained by hydrolysis of a nucleic acid, such as adenosine or guanine. "
Nucleotide,Any of various compounds consisting of a nuceloside combined with a phosphate group and forming the basic constituent of DNA and RNA.
Nucleus,Where the DNA is kept and RNA is transcribed
Organ,Organ comprise different types of tissues working together to perform a particular function
Organelle,"Small structures within the cells that perform a specific function. ""small organs""."
Peptide,Any of various natural or synthetic compounds containing two or more amino acids linked by the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another.
Peptide Bond,"Peptide bond formation is condensation reaction leading to the polymerization of amino acids into peptides and proteins. Small, consisting of a few amino acids. Simplest peptide is depeptide."
Peroxisome,A special type of vacuole responsible for the detoxification of many toxic compounds including alcohol and hydrogen peroxide.
Prokaryotic Cell ,A cell with an undefined nucleus. A cell wall and lack of membrane bound organelles characterize it.
Protein,Class of organic compounds which are present in and vital to every cell. A large molecule composed of one or more chains of amino acids in a specific order determined by base sequence
Ribose,"A pentose sugar, C5H10O5, occuring as a component of riboflavin, nucleotides, and nucleic acids. "
Ribosomes,"Sites of protein synthesis, where RNA is translated into protein"
