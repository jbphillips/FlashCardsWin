Alpha1  Antitrypson,Inhibits trypson to prevent breakdown of lung tissue
Apneustic,In the pons; provides inspiratory drive
Atelectasis,Lack of air and/or surfactant in avoli causes it to collapse
Bibasilar,Both bases of the lungs
Bleb,Pimple on the visceral pleura
Blue Bloater,Bronchitis
Chronic Bronchitis,Excessive muscus production
Ciliary Mucus Elevator System,Hairlike processes & mucus in respiratory tract that move secretions and contaminants upward so they can be coughed out
Consolidation,Pneumonia; act of becoming solid
COPD,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Dead Space,Space between nose and bronchioles; the air that never reaches the alveoli (about 150mL).
Emphysema,Increased size of air spaces due to over production of trypson and other destructive forces such as smoking; also alters the walls making gas exchange difficult
Empyema,Puss in the pleural space
Epiglottitis,Bacterial infection of the epiglottis
Gridlock,Diaphragm is forced upward by distended stomach not allowing it to move down to pull air into the lungs
Hilus,Entrance of the lungs. Only place where blood vessels enter.
Lung Abscess,Closed parenchymal infection
Macintosh,Curved blade for laryngoscope
Magill Forceps,Used to remove objects from the throat
Miller,Straight blade for laryngoscope
Minute Volume,The volume of air you breathe in a minute
Mucus Plug,Due to over production of mucus that dries and thickens. Forms hard plug that obstructs the airway
Partial Pressure,Pressure exerted by each component of gas
Pink Puffer,Emphysema
Pleurisy,Inflammation of the membrane that lines both lungs
Pneumonia,Bacterial infection of the lungs
Pneumosepsis,Sepsis originating from a lung infection
Pneumotaxic,Area in pons that regulates breathing
Pulmonary Edema,Fluid in lungs due to left heart failure; sometimes seen in right failure
Pulmonary Effusion,Escape of fluid into the lungs
Pulmonary Embolus,"Mass in pulmonary artery or one of its branches blocking blood flow. A thrombus that travels from the blood vessel or heart to another location in the body is called an embolus; and the disorder; an embolism. For example; an embolus that occurs in the lungs is called a pulmonary embolism.
"
Rhonchus,On auscultation; snoring sound heard over lungs. Asthma
Shunt,Diverts flow
Spontaneous Pneumothorax,When a bleb pops; usually seen in tall thin men. Up to 20% pneumothorax is usually well tolerated & heals itself 
Vallecula,Indentation at the base of the tongue above the epiglottis
Vital Capacity,The volume of air you expel after a full inspiration
Wheeze,On expiration; squeaking high pitched sound; often audible to unaided ear. Musical sound; air passing thru very constricted airways. Asthma; Emphysema; COPD
Agonal ,"Gasping respirations; long times between breaths; ""dying respirations"""
Air Hunger,Caused by dyspnea; pt gets restless nervous and starts flailing around; they need O2 or they will be a code soon
Ataxia,No pattern at all; common in seizure patients
Biot's,Runs of 3 or 4 deep fast breaths with apnea between; very rare; Biot's respiration is caused by damage to the medulla oblongata
Bronchophony,"Have pt say ""99""; you can hear it over consolidated areas"
Cheyne-Stokes,Shallow progessing to very deep back to shallow with apnea in between
Compliance,Measure of the force required to distend the lungs.
Egophony,"Have pt say ""E""; over areas of consolidation; you'll hear a nasal ""A"""
Hiccup,"""Singultus"". Believed to be caused by chemical or phrenic nerve irritation. ** Can be a serious sign indicating DMI."
Kussmaul's ,Deep gasping respirations; seen with diabetic acidosis and coma. DKA
Pursed Lip Breathing,Used to create back pressure & prevent avoli from collapsing; PEEP
Rales,Crackles; air thru smaller airways often heard with PE
Rhonchi,Larger upper airways; wet rattling sound.
Sigh,Deep inspiration followed by audible expiration
Sneeze,Explosive movement of air; naturally occuring to clear the nasal cavity
Sputum Color,Green or yellow may indicate lung infection. 
Stridor,High pitched; harsh sound due to partially obstructed airway
Subcutaneous emphysema,Subcutaneous emphysema occurs when air gets into tissues under the skin covering the chest wall or neck. This can happen due to stabbing; gun shot wounds; other penetrations; or blunt trauma. Subcutaneous emphysema can often be seen as a smooth bulging of the skin. When a health care provider feels (palpates) the skin; it produces an unusual crackling sensation as the gas is pushed through the tissue
Tripoding,Position pt is usually found in with severe difficulty breathing. Pt is leaning forward with elbows on knees; with head in the sniffing position
