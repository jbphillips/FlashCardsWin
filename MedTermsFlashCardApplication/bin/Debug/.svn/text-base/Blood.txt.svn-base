Agglutiation,A mass of congealed blood cells resembling a blood clot that are glued together by antibodies
Albumen,An egg-white-like water soluble substance synthesized in the liver whose purpose is to make up blood volume.
Anemias,Conditions in which there is a decreased amount of RBC's in the blood or decreased amount of hemoglobin. Deficiency of oxygen carrying capabilities deficient RBC's or deficient hemoglobin. Anemic pt's want to chew ice headache pale palpable conjunctiva tissues. Lines in their hand's will stay the same color when hyperextended.
Antiplatelet,Agent that destroys platelets ASA (aspirin) is used as an antiplatelet in many pt's with atherosclerosis to prevent coronary artery blockages.
Bile ,A Greenish/yellow fluid secreted by the liver concentrated and stored in the gallbladder and discharged into the intestine where it aids in the digestion of fats. It is very alkaline and helps neutralize the low pH of the stomach acid. 
Bilirubin or Bileheme,A pigment located in stool bile and urine also makes the blood red. It is really yellow in color but changes with its exposure to light.
Carboxyhemoglobin,Formed by carbon monoxide (CO) & hemoglobin. This prevents the hemoglobin from transporting O2
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy,(DIC): A pathological form of coagulation that is diffuse rather than localized. The process damages rather than protects the area involved & several clotting factors are consumed to such a great extent that generalized bleeding may occur.
Embolus,A thrombus that travels from the blood vessel or heart to another location in the body is called an embolus and the disorder an embolism. For example an embolus that occurs in the lungs is called a pulmonary embolism.
Erythroblastosis Fetalis,Hemolytic Disease of the newborne. Develops when a Rh-negative woman carries a Rh- positive fetus. Fetal RBC's cross the placenta & enter the mother's circulation causing antibody production against the Rh factor. These antibodies cross back into fetal circulation & destroy the fetal RBC's. The drug Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) is used to prevent the mother from becoming sensitized to the Rh-positive fetus preventing Erythroblastosis Fetalis.
Erythocytes (RBC's),Red blood cells carry O2 to the cells. Functional for 120 days. They are then destroyed by the spleen and then prepared for recomposition.
Erythropoietin,A hormone formed in the kidney that stimulates RBC production
Globulin,The functional portion of plasma. Some globulins are antibodies (immunoglobulins) and others transport lipids iron and copper
Hematology,The study of blood & the blood forming tissues
Hemoglobin,The iron rich substance in RBC's that carries O2. Hemoglobin a visceral protein which is located within an erythrocyte is red. This makes the erythrocyte appear red making blood appear red. Blood is clear.
Humours,Four humours which are held in balance when a person is healthy. All diseases and disabilities result from an excess or deficit in one of these four humors. These four humors were black bile yellow bile phlegm and blood.
Leukemia,"White Blood" disease characterized by unrestrained growth of leukocytes (leukoblasts) in the tissues
Leukocytes (WBC's),White blood cells defenders of the body broken into 2 groups: Granulated (basophils eosinphils neutrophils) Ungranulated (monocytes lymphocytes). WBC's are able to leave the vasculature to go after foreign substances in the body
Methemoglobinemia,Condition which more than 1% of hemoglobin in blood has been oxidized to the ferric (Fe+++) form. The principle sign is cyanosis because the oxidized hemoglobin is not capable of transporting O2. This condition can be brought on by the use of nitrates therefore PMD's usually prescribe a break in the medication regime to prevent this from occurring. In some instances such as Cyanide poisoning we will induce this condition using amyl nitrate which decreases the RBC's affinity for the Cyanide. 
Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve,Curve that shows the relationship between the partial pressure of O2 & the percentage saturation of hemoglobin with O2. Acidosis shifts the curve to the right decreasing the affinity of hemoglobin for O2. This make more O2 available for the bodies use.
Plasma,The watery portion of the blood. Plasma has clotting proteins
Platelets (Thrombocytes),Thrombocytes start the clotting cascade
Polycythemia,An excess of red blood cells often caused by lowered O2 tension in blood.
Rh Factor,When present its Rh+  if you don't have the factor it's Rh-.  Rh- can't receive Rh+ because antibodies will be created to attack the Rh factor. Rh+ can receive Rh- blood with no problems.
Rouleaux's Formation,A stack-like arrangement (like coins) of red blood cells in blood or in diluted suspensions of blood in which their biconcave surfaces are next to each other.
Sickle Cell Anemia,Hereditary chronic form of anemia in which abnormal sickle or crescent-shaped erythrocytes are present. The frequency of gene that causes this disease is high in black population.
Sickle Cell Crisis,The sickled cells interfere with O2 transport obstruct capillary blood flow & cause fever & severe pain in joints & the abdomen. This usually precipitated by decreased ambient O2.
Serum,Serum is blood plasma without fibrinogen or the other clotting factors (i.e. whole blood minus both the cells and the clotting factors)
Thrombus,A blood clot that forms in a blood vessel or within the heart and remains there is called a thrombus
Typing & Cross Matching,The ABO system: AB ABO. AB+ is the universal recipient. O- is universal donor. "A" has anti-B antibody so that if you gave an ""A"" blood type person ""B"" blood the anti-B antibodies would attack the "B" blood causing hemolytic reaction. The Rh factor must also be used in matching blood
Whole Blood,"Blood plasma nutrients and all other substances contained in blood
