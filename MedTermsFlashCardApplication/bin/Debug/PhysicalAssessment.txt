12 Cranial Nerves,Remember: Ooh  ooh  ooh to touch & feel a grape vine - so hot
1. Olfactory,Smell
2. Optic,Retinal vision (Snellen Chart)
3. Oculomotor,Dilates pupil - all eye movement except downward  inward & lateral. Pupil dilation
4. Trochlear,Eye movement. Moves eyes downward & inward
5. Trigeminal,Scalp  cheeks & mandible. Somatosensory information (touch  pain) from the face and head; muscles for chewing (mastication).
6. Abducines,Lateral eye movement
7. Facial,Taste (anterior 2/3 of tongue); Somatosensory information from ear; Controls muscles used in facial expression.
8. Auditory (Vestibulocohlear),Hearing & balance
9. Glossopharyngeal,Gag reflex. Taste (posterior 1/3 of tongue); Somatosensory information for tongue  tonsil  pharynx; Controls some muscles used in swallowing.
10. Vagus,Parasympathetic nervous system. Sensory  motor and autonomic functions of viscera (glands  digestion and heart rate)
11. Spinal Accessory,Shrug shoulders. Controls muscles used in head movement
12. Hypoglossal,Under tongue. Controls muscles of tongue
Agonal Respirations,"Gasping respirations; long times between breaths  ""dying respirations"""
Apnea,Pause in breathing
Ataxia,No pattern at all  common in seizure patients. Gross lack of coordination of muscle movements.
Ausculatory Gap,Where you hear the pulse stop while taking BP & then it comes back as the pressure in the cuff drops. This can make you miss high BP if you don't also palpate. 
Biot's,Runs of 3 or 4 deep fast breaths with apnea between  very rare
Blood Pressure,The pressure the blood exerts on the arterial side. Systolic BP is the higher pressure exerted when the heart contracts  diastolic is the resdiual pressure while the heart is at rest. 140/90 is the limit for normal  if either number is higher in a resting person  they have high BP.
Bradypnea,Slow rate; normal volume
Borborygmi,Loud  high-pitched bowel sounds  often associated with rushes. Small Bowel Obstruction
Braxton Hicks Contractions,Painless uterine contractions occuring after the 28th week
Buck's Hammer,Used to test for deep tendon reflexes
Cheyne-Stokes,Shallow progessing to very deep back to shallow with apnea in between
Clubbing,Characteristic down-turning of the fingernails. Central cyanosis from any cause  Infective Endocarditis
Electronic Thermometry,Buy them at the drug store. Inexpensive & accurate. Should use disposable covers for infection control
Eupnea,Normal respiration
Hyperpnea,High volume; normal rate. Increased depth of breathing
Hypopnea,Shallow volume; normal rate. Overly shallow breathing or an abnormally low respiratory rate.
Kussmaul Respirations,Extreme centrally activated hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis). Diabetic Ketoacidosis - DKA
Orthoscopy,Used to test for long bone fractures  place it on the knee cap. If the bone is fractured  the sound will not be transmitted to the pubic bone.
Percussion,Technique of placing one or two fingers on the pt & tapping them with a finger from your other hand or a Taylor Hammer to illict sound. A resonanating sound under area you percuss usually means air spaces such as your lungs or a hollow organ like the stomach. Loud resonsance could mean pneumothorax  dull sounds usually indicate solid organs or a hemothorax
Pronator Drift,Tests pt's proprioception (ability to know where you are in space). Have pt hold arms out in front with palms up  with eyes closed palms & arms should stay in place  if one hand drops then the pt has a positive pronator drift on that side (contralateral side of the brain). It can be as mild as just the pinky finger dropping to as severe as the entire arm drifting down to the pt's side.
Pulse,Felt during systole  can be strong  weak  thready  regular  irregular  bounding or absent. A carotid pulse indicates adequate blood pressure to perfuse the vital organs. 70 to 80 per minute is normal for most resting adults  highly conditioned athletes can have a resting pulse in the 50's.
Pulsus Paradoxus,Blood pressure can yield information about lungs  measures degree of obstruction  cardiac tamponade or anything else that exerts pressure on the heart. Systolic BP will come & go with respirations  inhale you don't hear it - exhale you do hear it. Take the highest systolic reading while pt is exhaling (this you will hear come & go) & go down to point where you get a steady systolic reading  note both. Finish taking BP with diastolic reading & record it the following ways: 160/140/80 or 160/80 with PP of 20. A reading under 10 is mild  10-20 moderate  20-30 severe  over 30 is critical.
Respirations,"Breathing; normal for adults is 12 to 20 per minute  can be labored  shallow  ""tight""  wheezing  can be using accessory muscles to breath causing pulsus paradoxus."
Romberg Test,Neurologic test for position sense. Pt stands with feet together with eyes open  then closed for 20-30 seconds  if pt looses balance with eyes closed it is positive Romberg test. A little swaying is normal. Cerebral Disease  ETOH
Tachypnea,Fast rate; normal volume. Rapid shallow breaths
Taylor Hammer,Used for percussion  soft triangular end
Tongue Depressors,Used for snouters reflex or break in half for Babinski's
Tympanic Thermometry,Uses the typamic membrane (ear drum) to take pt temperature
