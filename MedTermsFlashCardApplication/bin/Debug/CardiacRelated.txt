Accessory Pathway,Seen in WPW... pt has an extra conduction path that bypasses the AV node causing short PRI's & delta waves.

Chronotropic,Pertaining to the heart rate
Compensatory Pause,A pause noted on an electrocardiogram after a premature complex. It precedes the next normal complex
Cor Pulmonale,Hypertrophy of right ventricle due to a lung disorder (CHF)
Delta Waves,An accessory pathway called the Bundle of Kent provides a short cut to the ventricles (WPW Syndrome). This causes a slurring of the 'PR' segment shortening the interval between atrial & ventricular contraction.
